ABSTRACT

The intestinal microbiome has a crucial role in preserving the structural and functional integrity of the gut lining, making it a vital mediator of host physiological and pathological processes. The significance of the gut microbiome on health and disease is increasingly acknowledged. Acting as a "secondary brain" during food intake, the gut microbiome is profoundly affected by Western dietary habits, which contribute to the rise in obesity rates. This results in a shift towards gut dysbiosis, which is a key factor in obesity-related complications. During adolescence, negative experiences may cause lasting changes in adult brain function, behavior, and mood states. Obesity during this time can have a particularly significant impact. Research has associated obesity with an increased risk of cognitive impairment, including deficits in short-term memory and executive function, as well as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Both animal models and human studies suggest that the microbiome associated with obesity contributes to the endocrine, neurochemical, and inflammatory changes that underlie obesity and its comorbidities, such as HPA-axis dysregulation, alterations in neuroactive metabolite levels, and the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to neuroinflammation. The gut microbiome can directly influence the central nervous system (CNS) by modulating endocrine signaling pathways within the microbiota-gut-brain axis, such as GLP-1 and PYY signaling, or by activating reward pathways. A healthy gut microbiome is essential for maintaining optimal metabolism and homeostasis, which substantially benefits the host in exchange for inhabiting and proliferating within the intestinal environment. Any alterations in the composition of the microbiome can disrupt host metabolism and affect homeostasis, a crucial process for regulating hunger and cognitive function.	

 
1.0	 Introduction 
Obesity is a major concern all over the world. Over 500 million individuals globally are obese, which poses a significant financial and public health burden. The composition of the gut microbiota and an overgrowth of microbes that extract more energy from food have been associated with obesity. The gut hormones produced by the changes in the gut microbiota leads to cognitive and mood disorders in one's body. The gut microbiota plays a significant role at both the local and global levels, and it has a symbiotic relationship with its host. The architectural and physiological anatomy of the stomach is influenced by gut bacteria under normal circumstances. Through the breakdown of dietary components, extraction of vital nutrients, vitamin synthesis, and favouring mineral absorption, they take part in digestion and obtain energy. Microbial dysbiosis, characterized by a shift from a diversified and beneficial bacterial profile to a maladaptive and pathogenic one, is associated with various pathological conditions observed in obese patients. Obesity is a significant health problem that is linked to increased morbidity and mortality rates. The feeding system, also known as the gut-brain axis, is a complex feedback mechanism between the gut and the brain. It is well-established that the gut-brain axis plays a critical role in regulating energy balance. This review article will explore the relationship between the microbiota and the gut-brain axis in obesity and how it affects cognitive function and mood.

2.0 The Gut Microbiome
The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, yeasts, and helminth parasites. The commensal microbiota is crucial for the immune system's function, nutrient processing, and other aspects of host physiology (Hopper et al., 2001; Macpherson et al., 2004; Macpherson et al., 2002; Macpherson et al., 2004; Tlaskalova et al., 2004). The relationship between the microbiota and the host is primarily one of mutual benefit, with the microbiota shaping our immune system throughout our lives. In a healthy individual, the gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by trillions of microbes. Each person's microbiota is unique in itself- types of species present, relative abundance and fairly stable. Microbiome of a person chances with the age of the person. Metagenomic studies have shown that the composition of the gut microbiota changes during the formative years of human development and is influenced by nutrition (Koenig et al., 2011). An Infants diet consists of a breast milk and baby formula so the infant's microbiome is minimum and less diverse so genes that help the body use lactate are higher in number in child's gut (Salazar et al. 2014). Ecological succession causes the infant's Bifidobacterium-dominated microbiota to evolve over time into an adult's microbiota that is dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (Ottman et al., 2012). In Elderly there is a significant decrease in Bacteriodes, Bifidobacteria and Bifidobacteria (Van et al. 2005). The microbiome of an individual can be affected and altered by these following reasons such as Stress, Geology, Food supply, Exercise, Critical illness, Antibiotics, and Gastric Acid Suppression etc. throughout his/ her life (Gupta et al. 2017).

3.0 Gut microbiota in obesity 
The gut microbiome aids the host by breaking down otherwise indigestible substances, such as various plant polysaccharides and complex carbohydrates. These substances are then transformed into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like propionate, butyrate, and acetate (Turnbaugh et al. 2006). It has been observed that obese individuals exhibit a lower relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and a higher abundance of Firmicutes compared to their lean counterparts. However, following weight loss, Bacteroidetes levels significantly increase (Ley et al., 2003). Butyrate serves as the primary energy source for colonic epithelial cells, while propionate and acetate play essential roles in liver lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively (Ley et al., 2003).
Low-grade inflammation is a characteristic feature of obesity and increases the risk of comorbidities such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Although the exact causes of low-grade inflammation in obesity remain elusive, several factors, including the gut microbiome, have been implicated. Alterations in the gut microbiome's composition in obesity have been associated with increased gut permeability, leading to the entry of substances such as lipopolysaccharide, an endotoxin produced by Gram-negative bacteria, into the systemic circulation (Mehrpouya et al., 2017). Elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide levels can induce neuroinflammation (Di Marzo, 2019) and trigger inflammatory cascades in adipose tissue, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Following a high-fat meal, obese individuals have been shown to have significantly higher plasma lipopolysaccharide levels than lean controls (Almeida et al., 2019), emphasizing the potential role of the gut microbiome in low-grade inflammation in human obesity.


4.0 Diet, Microbiota and Behavior
Research has demonstrated that the gut microbiota's composition is significantly impacted by diet (Jeffery et al., 2013). In humans, the dietary influence starts at an early stage, with the choice of feeding method playing a role in the infant's microbiota makeup. This is evidenced by differences in colonization patterns between newborns who are breastfed and those who are fed formula [58]. In a study involving mice, feeding them a diet containing 50% beef protein for three months resulted in an increase in gut microbiota diversity and behavioral changes (Li et al., 2009). The group that was fed the supplemented diet showed better working and reference memory and reduced anxiety compared to the group fed regular chow (Li et al., 2009). The mechanism behind the protein-enriched diet's effects is still unknown. However, it is evident that not all dietary changes are beneficial to host cognition, as a western-style diet high in fat and refined sugar was found to worsen anxiety-like behavior and lower memory performance in an IL-10 deficient mouse model with low-grade inflammation (Ohland et al., 2013). The introduction of probiotics containing Lactobacillus may help address these deficiencies. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the probiotics, inflammation, and diet's complex interaction affected the microbiota and behavior and whether the probiotics impacted the diet or the model system's ability to reduce inflammation.
A study involving healthy volunteers found that the administration of a fermented milk product supplemented with probiotic bacteria induced changes in brain intrinsic connectivity, particularly in the areas responsible for emotion and sensation central processing, as measured by neuroimaging using fMRI (Tillisch et al., 2013). However, continuous administration of fermented milk products enriched with probiotic organisms had no effect on the microbiota's composition compared to the placebo group (Tillisch et al., 2013). It remains to be seen whether these changes in brain connectivity positively affect pain sensitivity, stress response, mood, or anxiety. Conversely, in a study involving Vietnamese schoolchildren, supplementation with milk or a milk beverage fortified with inulin resulted in weight gain, decreased anemia, and raised blood zinc levels, all of which were associated with microbiota modifications compared to the reference control group (Lien et al., 2009). Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides spp. levels specifically increased in both treatment groups, which was accompanied by better short-term memory scores and quality of life (Lien et al., 2009). However, a third trial showed that while a probiotic-containing beverage improved mood in healthy individuals, this effect was only observed in people who scored in the lowest third overall. Interestingly, the placebo group showed a slight improvement in memory compared to the probiotic group. Therefore, while these findings suggest that dietary changes may eventually influence behavior, including cognition, in individuals with intestinal illnesses, it is still unclear whether this reflects an effect on the microbiota. Furthermore, investigations in relevant patient populations are currently limited, so extrapolating from findings in healthy volunteers may not be practical.

5.0 Gut brain axis: Bidirectional Pathway 
The bidirectional pathway known as the "gut-brain axis" is critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Communication between the gut and brain occurs through various mechanisms involving the vagus nerve, enteroendocrine cells, and the enteric system. The gut microbiome can modulate these signals by producing metabolites.

During feeding, several neuroendocrine processes are activated. Enteroendocrine cells located in the gut epithelium release hormones and neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), in response to nutritional and mechanical stimuli (Gribble et al., 2016; Worthington et al., 2018). These endocrine hormones influence secretion (insulin, gastric acid, bile acids), gut motility, and food intake through vagal afferent neurons, the enteric nervous system, or release into the bloodstream (Symonds et al., 2015; Chin et al., 2012; Bellono et al., 2017). The gut microbiome can modulate the release of these hormones and neurotransmitters by producing metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Nohr et al., 2013; Modasia et al., 2020).

The vagus nerve, which plays a role in gastrointestinal motility, food intake, and has anti-inflammatory properties, can be activated by gastrointestinal tract distension, hormones, peptides produced by enteroendocrine cells, or microbial metabolites (Bonaz et al., 2015). Ghrelin, PYY, and CCK can all directly inhibit or stimulate the vagus nerve (Cui et al., 2011; Koda et al., 2005; Lieverse et al., 1995). Numerous studies have associated microbial dysbiosis in obesity with vagus nerve innervation and signaling (Sen et al., 2017; Serre et al., 2015). Moreover, previous research in mice and humans has shown that vagotomy affects body weight, emphasizing the critical role of the vagus nerve in human metabolism and food intake (Kral et al., 1993; Balbo et al., 2016).

The enteric nervous system, connected to the vagus nerve, comprises a network of neurons distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, regulating gut motility, blood flow, and secretion. The enteric nervous system can function autonomously, detecting and integrating information, but it can also communicate with the central nervous system via the vagus nerve (Furness et al., 2014; Fung et al., 2020). Animal studies have demonstrated that the enteric nervous system can still operate even when the vagus nerve is severed (Kabouridis et al., 2015). The gut microbiome can directly or indirectly signal the enteric nervous system by producing neurotransmitters and SCFAs, and by influencing bacterial metabolites on EECs. Studies on germ-free mice suggest that the gut microbiome plays a role in the maturation of the enteric nervous system, and even in adults, the enteric nervous system may be susceptible to microbial intervention (Kabouridis et al., 2015).

The gut microbiome converts dietary nutrients into plasma metabolites, including SCFAs such as lactate, butyrate, propionate, acetate, and succinate, as well as neurotransmitters like GABA, dopamine, and serotonin, all of which have significant roles in the gut-brain axis. SCFAs produced from dietary fibers interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPR), specifically GPR43 and GPR41, and serve as essential signaling molecules (Poul et al., 2003). Although the majority of the intestinally generated SCFAs are utilized within the intestine, a small portion can indirectly affect satiety by stimulating the production of PYY and GLP-1 through interactions with enteroendocrine cells. In addition to their indirect effects on satiety through enteroendocrine cells, SCFAs can also directly affect food intake by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the vascular system. Mouse studies have shown that acetate can cross the BBB and trigger anorexigenic signals in the hypothalamus, resulting in reduced food intake (Frost et al., 2014). Acetate and butyrate have also been found to increase thermogenesis and energy expenditure in obese mice, in addition to modulating satiety. Studies in rats have demonstrated that propionate and butyrate can enhance intestinal gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, research in mice has shown that activation of GPR43 by SCFAs leads to a reduction in fat storage in adipose tissue and promotes glucose metabolism in the liver and muscle (Kimura, 2013).

In this context, studies have investigated the role SCFAs play in obesity. For example, research in mice using dietary SCFA supplementation has been shown to inhibit weight gain induced by a high-fat diet (Lu et al. 2016). Obese humans have been found to have higher fecal levels of SCFAs compared to lean individuals (Schwiertz et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2013). However, the exact mechanism by which SCFAs affect appetite, glucose metabolism, and energy expenditure remains unclear and requires further investigation. Additionally, the effects of SCFAs may vary depending on individual factors such as age, diet, and health status. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and limitations of using SCFAs as a therapeutic tool for metabolic disorders.

6.0 Routes of signaling 

1.	Vagus Nerve Signaling The vagus nerve (VN) comprises 80% afferent and 20% efferent fibers connecting the brain, and it facilitates interoceptive awareness (Strigo et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2017; Bonaz et al. 2018). The central autonomic network, including the parabrachial nucleus, periventricular and lateral hypothalamus, and amygdala, plays a vital role in the parasympathetic nervous system. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) represents the primary entry point for vagal afferents into the brain. Vagal fibers can be activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) via GPR41, altering neurotransmitter levels, reducing inflammation, and decreasing body weight. Research suggests that probiotic-mediated VN activation influences neurotransmitter release and behavior. Additionally, endocannabinoids (eCBs) and eCB-like mediators modulate VN mechanosensitive response through cholecystokinin (CCK) and TRPV1 molecular pathways. Enteroendocrine cell activation by bacterial products results in hormone release, including serotonin, orexins, CCK, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, and ghrelin, which interact with vagal afferents via their respective receptors (Li et al. 2000). In obese mice, excess leptin can inhibit tension-sensitive mechanoreceptors, acting as orexigenic signals. Lastly, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can cross the gut epithelium and reach VN terminals expressing Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
2.	Enteroendocrine Signaling Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) maintain gut homeostasis by regulating insulin secretion and food absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Gribble et al. 2016). In the distal small and large intestines, enteroendocrine L-cells and enterochromaffin cells are the most abundant EECs, situated close to various bacterial taxa. These cells directly interact with luminal components, including bacterial metabolites, through their apical surface. Postprandial peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are potent anorexigenic hormones produced by enteroendocrine L cells, with their receptors expressed locally in gut enteric neurons, vagal afferents, brain stem, and hypothalamus (De Silva et al. 2012; Richards et al. 2014). PYY and GLP-1 can operate on the hypothalamus directly or indirectly via the vagal-brainstem-hypothalamic pathway, where specific receptors are located (Latorre et al.2016; Steinert et al. 2017). SLC5A1, FFAR1, and FFAR4 transporters, which transport sodium-coupled glucose, long-chain fatty acids, and monoacylglycerols, respectively, in the proximal luminal gut, are involved in the postprandial spike of GLP-1 and PYY peptide release. However, in the distal gut, bacterial compounds almost exclusively activate L cells. Obese individuals often exhibit lower serum GLP-1 and PYY levels.
3.	Enteric Nervous System The enteric nervous system (ENS), consisting of a network of neurons in the submucosal and myenteric plexus, primarily coordinates gastrointestinal motility (Cryan et al. 2020). The ENS and central nervous system (CNS) share the same neurochemistry and communicate through spinal and vagal channels that transmit afferent signals to the CNS via intestine fugal projections to sympathetic ganglia (Cryan et al. 2020). These neural pathways are the primary means by which components produced by the gut microbiota are transferred to the CNS. For example, obesity or the presence of food in the gut can suppress vagal afferents to the NTS through enteric nervous system-mediated communication from the gut to the brain, thereby regulating energy balance by reducing c-fos expression in the NTS of obese rats (Berthoud et al. 2008). The vagus nerve may also play a role in modulating food intake through microbial regulation of food consumption. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of microbiota-produced serotonin (5HT) in ENS neurogenesis (De Vadder et al. 2018) and the detrimental effects of antibiotic therapy on the neurochemistry and function of the ENS architecture's neuronal and glial components (Bistoletti et al. 2019).

7.0 Gut hormones and mood disorders 
The interplay between metabolic, reward, and cognitive processes in appetite control has been extensively researched, focusing on gut-brain hormones due to their cognitive effects in severe mental illnesses. Antipsychotic medications can alter the neuro-hormone homeostasis and cause weight gain, potentially explaining the intricate relationship between clinical improvement and weight gain in these patients. Gut flora changes can disrupt the release of gastrointestinal peptides involved in metabolic processes related to energy homeostasis (Lupien-Meilleur et al., 2020). This section will explore the impact of various gut-brain hormones on the cognitive effects of severe mental disorders.

It is now widely acknowledged that many gut hormones significantly influence food intake control in the CNS. The frequent co-occurrence of mental disorders and obesity is of particular interest. Several gut hormones, including serotonin (5-HT), neuropeptide Y (NPY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), and ghrelin, have been associated with mood disorders (anxiety and depression).

Enterochromaffin cells in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine produce 5-HT, which can act as a neurotransmitter in the CNS, regulating mood, sleep, and appetite (Herr et al. 2017). Although peripheral and central 5-HT are produced separately and separated by the blood-brain barrier, they are closely related to CNS function. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid and 5-HT precursor, significantly affects the CNS, ENS, and brain-gut axis communication, and its metabolism through the kynurenine pathway in the periphery can profoundly impact its availability in the CNS (Kennedy et al. 2017). Furthermore, 5-HT derived from enterochromaffin cells has crucial effects on immunological control. Prior research found that endotoxin injection could induce 5-HT release to plasma from platelets. Although the immune system's role of 5-HT is not fully understood, some studies suggest it may affect both innate and adaptive immunity, promoting cytokine release from lymphocytes and monocytes and influencing CNS functioning (Rasmussen et al. 2012; Blevins et al. 2000).

The neuropeptide Y family, including NPY, pancreatic polypeptide, and peptide YY (PYY), affects neurogenesis, neuroprotection, and stress-related diseases. Abnormalities in NPY have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). NPY has been investigated in various mental conditions, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia, with potential diagnostic or treatment-response biomarker applications. Additionally, animal studies have shown that NPY treatment can have neuroprotective and neurogenic effects in neurodegenerative diseases.

GLP-1, besides its insulin-secreting capacity, has shown cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective effects in several animal model studies of neurodegenerative disorders (Erbil et al. 2019; McClean et al. 2010). However, a clinical trial evaluating the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide in schizophrenia patients did not demonstrate significant improvement in cognitive or psychosocial function (Ishy et al. 2017; Gumuslu et al. 2016). Conversely, liraglutide therapy as an add-on treatment improved cognitive function, including processing speed, verbal memory, and attention, in individuals with mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder (Mansur et al. 2017). CCK, which is produced abundantly in the CNS and peripheral nervous system, primarily regulates caloric intake. Additionally, elevated levels of CCK have been linked to increased anxiety-like behaviors in both mice and humans, and it seems to affect mood disorders through various neurotransmitters such as glutamate, dopamine, acetylcholine, and GABA, which play critical roles in emotional responses.

Ghrelin has been found to regulate stress response, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in addition to its well-known adipogenic and orexigenic properties. Its effects on neurogenesis expanded its significance in spatial memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in animal models (Chen et al., 2011). According to Santos et al. (2017), administering endogenous ghrelin in animal models of neurodegeneration can slow down disease progression and improve cognitive function by activating insulin signaling pathways. Furthermore, rats given [DLys(3)] GHRP-6, a ghrelin receptor analogue, exhibited improved cognitive performance and lower hippocampal amyloid-beta and acetylcholinesterase levels (Madhavadas et al., 2014).

In summary, the therapeutic application of these hormones beyond eating disorders (Culbert et al., 2016) appears promising, although the majority of the evidence is at a preclinical level. It is essential to note that these hormones play a critical role in maintaining energy homeostasis.

8.0 Therapeutic modulation of Gut Brain Axis 

Probiotics and Prebiotics
Probiotics refer to living, beneficial bacteria and yeasts that naturally reside in the body, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. In mice and rats fed a high-fat diet, probiotics containing Bifidobacterium have been shown to have positive effects on gut health by improving barrier function, reducing bacterial translocation and endotoxemia, and decreasing inflammation, insulin resistance, fat accumulation, as well as serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (Yin et al. 2010; Moya-Perez et al. 2015; Cano et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2011, 2012; An et al. 2011; Kondo et al. 2010). Similarly, studies on animal models of obesity have demonstrated that probiotics containing Studies using animal models of obesity have shown that probiotics containing strains of Lactobacillus can effectively reduce body fat mass, improve lipid profiles, and restore glucose homeostasis.
According to research, prebiotics are non-digestible polysaccharides that selectively stimulate the growth and activity of certain beneficial microbial taxa in the gut microbiota, providing health benefits to the host (Roberfroid et al. 2010). Prebiotics have been shown to affect a broad range of bacterial taxa and to reduce adipocyte size, body weight, and body fat through microbiome manipulation. This effect is mediated by reduced food intake, decreased appetite, and decreased fatty acid storage.
Fecal Metabolic Transplant (FMT) 
FMT, or faecal microbiota transplantation, involves injecting the intestinal tract of a patient with the faeces of a healthy donor. However, studies have shown that if the donor is obese, FMT can increase body and fat mass in germ-free mice (Ridaura et al. 2013). FMT has been investigated as a potential treatment for a variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal conditions related to microbial dysbiosis, such as irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic disorders.


9.0 Conclusion
Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in gut microbiota, influenced by dietary factors, may play a role in neuroinflammation and neuroendocrine system dysregulation, both of which are associated with obesity and mental health disorders. Various probiotics and other microbiota-modifying interventions have been investigated for their potential to mitigate obesity and concomitant mental health issues. The gut microbiota is implicated in energy metabolism through processes such as regulating fat storage and fatty acid oxidation, suggesting that interventions targeting the gut microbiota could be a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing obesity.
Moreover, the gut microbiota can directly impact the central nervous system by modulating endocrine signaling pathways, such as GLP-1 and peptide YY, and by activating reward pathways that enhance cognitive function and mood. As our understanding of the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota, obesity, and mental health disorders continues to grow, innovative and targeted interventions may be developed to improve the overall health and well-being of individuals affected by these conditions.
In conclusion, the dynamic interplay between the gut microbiota, obesity, and mental health disorders presents a compelling area of research with significant potential for advancing treatment options. By delving deeper into the mechanisms underlying the gut-brain axis and its effects on energy metabolism and cognitive function, novel therapeutic approaches can be developed to address the complex challenges posed by obesity and associated mental health disorders.
